        <h1>AI-Assisted Software Engineering</h1>
        <p>AI-assisted software engineering is the use of artificial intelligence tools to support, improve, and accelerate the process of building software. It does not replace developers; it enhances their capability, speed, and decision-making.
             Instead of writing every line of code manually, engineers now collaborate with AI systems that can generate,
              review, optimize, and test code in real time.One major shift in this space is the rise of generative AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot developed by GitHub. These tools are trained on massive datasets of code and natural language. They understand programming patterns, documentation styles, and architecture structures. A developer can describe a feature in plain English, and the AI can generate a functional code snippet in languages such as JavaScript, Python, or Java.
               This reduces development time and helps beginners move faster</p>
               <h2>AI assistance operates across the entire software development lifecycle</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>CODE GENERATION:</strong> AI can scaffold applications, write boilerplate code, create APIs, and generate database schemas. 
                        This allows engineers to focus more on system design and 
                        business logic instead of repetitive tasks</li>
                        <li><strong>CODE REVIEW AND DEBUGGING:</strong> AI tools analyze code for syntax errors, 
                            performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities,
                             and bad practices. They can suggest refactoring improvements and explain why a certain bug may occur. 
                            This increases code quality and reduces human oversight errors.</li>
                            <li><strong>TESTING AND QA AUTOMATION:</strong>AI can automatically generate unit tests, integration tests, and edge-case scenarios. It can simulate user behavior and detect failures early in the pipeline. 
                                This improves reliability and speeds up deployment cycles </li><br>
                                <li><strong>DOCUMENTATION AND KNOWLEDGE SUPPORT:</strong>AI can convert complex code into human-readable documentation, summarize large codebases, and explain legacy systems.
                                     This is useful in onboarding new developers and maintaining large enterprise systems</li>           
                </ol>
                <h3>Here’s a detailed list of AI-assisted software engineering tools (focused on code writing, review, testing, design, and dev workflow automation)</h3>
